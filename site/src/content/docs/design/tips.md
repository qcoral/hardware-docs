There's a lot of stuff you need to watch out for when designing your project on the computer to make sure that you can actually build them in real life! Here are some of them:

- Add a ~0.2mm tolerances on any 3D printed part that makes contact with something else - this is to account for any inaccuracies in your printer, the filament, etc. Your parts WILL NOT fit otherwise
- You can print out your PCBs on paper and see how large they'll be before actually ordering to get a good gauge for size
- Frequently think about how your parts are actually going to be manufactured and whether or not it's realistic - intricate patterns may often not show up as well depending on your manufacturing method (3D printing, CNC milling, etc)
