## Generally useful stuff

- Search stuff up! Again and again and again. You'll have to do a _lot_ of the learning yourself so its on you

## Finding 3D models & libraries

- [GrabCAD community library](https://grabcad.com/library) (this has LITERALLY any 3D model you can think of)
- [SnapEDA](https://www.snapeda.com/) has footprints & symbols for most electronics components if you can't find one online, but I would recommend making your own when possible

## Useful software

- [Excalidraw] is an awesome site for making really quick sketches that look good
- For PCB design, use [KiCAD!](https://www.kicad.org/). It's free, open source, and works on any platform.
- For 3D modelling, use either Fusion360 or Onshape!

## Technical resources

- [Ellis' 3D print tuning guide](https://ellis3dp.com/Print-Tuning-Guide/) has swaths of really useful information
- [The Keyboard Atelier Designer Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K0jNUZzxTTMkgzo043dxc4vBEOrxNa8jVf4VHk-B27U/edit?gid=0#gid=0)
- Adafruit projects are extremely good for looking at what's behind-the-scenes of hardware projects

Here's a quick braindump of useful stuff that I've found useful over the years. Will be continuously added to as highway goes on!

## Project inspiration:

- [Adafruit] is one of my favourite resources! There are literally hundreds of insanely cool projects out there

## Communities

### Discords:

- [KiCAD](https://www.kicad.org/community/chat/) (PCB design and help)
- [QMK](https://discord.com/invite/qmk) (Keyboard firmware)
- [VORON](https://discord.com/invite/voron) (3D printing help)

### Subreddits:

- [r/mechanicalkeyboards](https://reddit.com/r/mechanicalkeyboards) (keyboard help)

## Measurements list:

These are the measurements I use to design parts for 3D prints!

- M3 screw head diamter: 6mm (this is both for socket head and button head - they're approx. the same!)
- M3 heatset inserts: 4.7mm OD
- M3 screw-ins for plastic: 2.9mm
- M2 screw-ins for plastic: 1.9mm
- M3 SHCS screw head depth:

Most of these were taken from the VORONDesign team's designs - I've found them to just generally work pretty well
