Here's a general list of resources & links that may be useful to you!

The most useful thing you can get from this though is to get into the habbit of searching stuff up! There are _so_ many resources out there and this page can only cover so much

### Finding 3D models & libraries

- [GrabCAD community library](https://grabcad.com/library) (this has LITERALLY any 3D model you can think of)
- [SnapEDA](https://www.snapeda.com/) has footprints & symbols for most electronics components if you can't find one online, but I would recommend making your own when possible

### Useful software

- [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) is an awesome site for making really quick sketches that look good
- For PCB design, use [KiCAD!](https://www.kicad.org/). It's free, open source, and works on any platform.
- For 3D modelling, use either Fusion360 or Onshape!

### Technical resources

- [Ellis' 3D print tuning guide](https://ellis3dp.com/Print-Tuning-Guide/) has swaths of really useful information
- [The Keyboard Atelier Designer Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K0jNUZzxTTMkgzo043dxc4vBEOrxNa8jVf4VHk-B27U/edit?gid=0#gid=0)

### Project inspiration:

- [Adafruit](https://learn.adafruit.com/guides/latest) is one of my favourite resources! There are literally hundreds of insanely cool projects out there.

### Communities

#### Discords:

- [KiCAD](https://www.kicad.org/community/chat/) (PCB design and help)
- [QMK](https://discord.com/invite/qmk) (Keyboard firmware)
- [VORONDesign](https://discord.com/invite/voron) - 3D printing discord dedicated to their ow

#### Subreddits:

- [r/mechanicalkeyboards](https://reddit.com/r/mechanicalkeyboards) (keyboard help)
- [r/QMK](https://reddit.com/r/QMK)
- [r/3DPrinting](https://reddit.com/r/3DPrinting)
- [r/electronics](https://reddit.com/r/electronics)

## Measurements list:

These are the measurements I use to design parts for 3D prints!

- M3 screw head diamter: 6mm (this is both for socket head and button head - they're approx. the same!)
- M3 heatset inserts: 4.7mm OD
- M3 screw-ins for plastic: 2.9mm
- M2 screw-ins for plastic: 1.9mm
- M3 SHCS screw head depth:

Most of these were taken from the VORONDesign team's designs - I've found them to just generally work pretty well
