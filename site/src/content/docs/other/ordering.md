not too sure where to put this. here are some tips for actually buying your parts:

- do your research on the different manufacturing options for the services you use - this mainly applies to PCBs but it's really important you actually understand what you're getting
- create a checklist for all the parts you need to order so that you don't miss anything; with complex projects it's super easy to miss a part or two and set back your project by weeks
- get 3D printed parts from [printing legion](https://printlegion.hackclub.com) - your part will be printed by a real human that you can talk to.
