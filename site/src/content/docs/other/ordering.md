## Sanity checking

Before you actually order your parts, you should sanity check your design first! It can save you a _lot_ of money, time, and resources later down the line. Here's some things you can do:

- Ask for feedback on your design in [other communities](/design#communities) - they're filled with experts who more often than not are willing to help
    - That being said, _do not_ spam!
- You can print out your PCB on paper to get a check for the fit & overall size _before_ ordering - this is a built in feature of KiCAD!
- Make checklists for each thing to check for _before_ sending things off to prod. Here's some examples:
    - your schematic has everything wired up correctly
    - DRC has no errors
    - You set tolerances on all parts
    - Your parts are all within speci

## Actually ordering

- do your research on the different manufacturing options for the services you use - this mainly applies to PCBs but it's really important you actually understand what you're getting
- create a checklist for all the parts you need to order so that you don't miss anything; with complex projects it's super easy to miss a part or two and set back your project by weeks
- get 3D printed parts from [printing legion](https://printlegion.hackclub.com) - your part will be printed by a real human that you can talk to.
