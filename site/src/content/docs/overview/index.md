Hey there!

I'm [alex](https://github.com/qcoral). I've been making hardware projects on and off for the past 10 years.

I think I've amassed a good amount of useful information I wish I knew back in the day. I think it would be useful to document them here

Let me know if you need any help! This page will be actively updated.
