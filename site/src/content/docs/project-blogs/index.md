Project blogs! In here are blogs written by teenagers all over the world on their experiences building their projects.

Want to add your project here? Here's what to do:

#### Contributing:

If you've physically built a project before from any hardware program, write a blog on it! Go over the design process, assembly, and how you got to the finished project.

Some good questions to answer are:

- what gave you the idea / what started it?
- what are some of the most interesting parts of the process / biggest surprises?
- what would you do differently?

After that, make a PR with your markdown file in `"site/src/content/docs/project-blogs"` (yes that's a handleful). The `.md` file should contain the following:

```Markdown
---
title: "@slack - Project_Name"
---

# Project Name

content....

```

Make sure to use #cdn for all the links! The only new files in your PR should be the single `.md` file

After that, let me know! ping me @alexren in some channel and I'll get to it.
