### About

Hey there!

I'm [alex](https://github.com/qcoral). I've been making hardware projects on and off for the past 10 years.

I think I've amassed a good amount of useful information I wish I knew back in the day. I think it would be useful to document them here.

I don't think there is a single good resource on this type of thing.

Have stuff you think should be added? Let me know!

Let me know if you need any help! This page will be actively updated.

### Contributing

GitHub repo can be found [here](https://github.com/qcoral/hardware-docs). You can suggest stuff by reaching out to me @alexren on slack diresctly.

Built with [astro starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/) and lots of \<3
