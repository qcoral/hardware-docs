## Written by: @Taran The Idiot

Hello! Here I will be teaching you how to write nice looking Readmes and Journals and how to use .md files.\
This is different from the How To Ship tutorial in that this shows you how to write in markdowns whereas the other one teaches you how to properly ship your project.

## Basics

First we go over the basic things you need to know when making a markdown

### Titles

You cant just press the enter key to start a new line in a markdown.\
You need to use these things called backward slashes. Its like a forward slash, but backwards.

```
hi\
how are you?
```

This is what it looks like to use a backward slash.\
You should still press enter between lines so its easier to read when editing.\
The Backward Slash can be found above the enter button.

If you dont put back slashes, your sentences would look like this:\
hi
how are you?
I am great thanks!

#### Paragraph breaks

To create a break for a paragraph you just press enter twice\

```
hi

How are you?
```

You dont put a backward slash on the last line of a paragraph, it wont do anything and you will be able to see the slash in the markdown.

### Lists

Links are useful for things like your bom or inspiration sections of your readme.\
Being able to put a hyper link without cluttering your page because its 100 characters long is really nice to have.
Format your links like so:\
` [Alt text](https://hackclub.com)`\
Alt text is the text that the link appears as.\
[it looks like this](https://hackclub.com)

## Advanced/Extra stuff

### Formatting

To put your text in _italics_, you need to add * to each end.\
Like so:\
`*hi\*`

_This makes the text Italic._

#### Bold (thick text)

## Line breaks can be added with `---`

Looks like that^

Any line directly above a break will become a title, put a line space between to make it not happen

You have seen throughout this guide where I add the raw code and the places I put it look different.\
How do I do this?\
Through codeblocks.

To use a code block, put `s on either end of the line.\
Like so:
`hi`

```
You can find this above the tab button
It is not an apostrophe
```

To add a big block of code that takes up multiple lines like above, use ``` on the line above and line below\
Like so:

````
```
hi
You can write multiple lines of code here
its good for showing snippets of code
```
````

You can use ~ instead of ` but I find the second one easier to use.

#### Quotes
