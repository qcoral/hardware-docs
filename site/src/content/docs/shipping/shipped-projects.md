title: "What is a shipped project?"
draft: true
---

Simply put, a shipped hardware project is one that can be easily used & understood by others. It should have the following things:

1. A complete README
2. All files in an easily interoperable format, with as little data loss as possible
3. Ideally, some sort of journal / behind the scenes!
