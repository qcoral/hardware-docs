title: "What is shipping?"
---

Hi there! This page is my best attempt at explaining the age old question of, _"what on earth is shipping??"_

In short, **shipping is process of actually making your project sharable**. It's _the_ most important part of your project, almost as important as the entire project itself

When you first make something, usually it just lives as a file on your computer. This is bad because only YOU can access it\! Nobody else can see it. Not only that, but when you look back at the project a few years from now it’ll be very, _very_ difficult to remember anything about it\! _It’s not real_

Shipping (at least in this context context) involves publishing your design out there for the world to see. Making it very real. This involves a couple steps:

-   **Documenting what your project actually is:**
    -   A quick story/motivation on how the project came to be
    -   A description of what the project does
    -   A quick brief on how it all fits together
    -   Some pictures of the design
-   **Making all files & resources easily accessible & organized**
-   **Putting it on a platform that's easily shareable (i.e github, printables, etc)**


_Unfortunately we also can't accept non shipped projects since it'd be impossible to tell what you even made. Make sure to ship your projects!_
